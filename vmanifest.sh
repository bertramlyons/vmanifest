#  Usage:  vmanifest [full path of directory]
#
#  * Assumes a single directory that contains a set of content files and a set of individual .md5 files
#  ** Generates manifest of md5s from individual md5 text files
#  ** Creates new md5s of the payload files
#  ** Runs diff against old manifest and new manifest and reports result
#  * Not recursive - input directory must contain all files directly
#
#  Remember to make the script executable: chmod +x vmanifest.sh
#
#  Requirements: for MAC OS only, assumes existence of MD5 utility that comes with MAC OS
#  This is an example script written by Bertram Lyons at IASA, 2015, in Paris, France for demonstration
